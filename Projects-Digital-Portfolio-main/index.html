          <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Through this experience, I've realized that although I was developing the fundamental skills of HTML, I didn't tailor it to my style. It is not until now, where I am more comfortable with code, that I feel like I can properly execute and devolop a signature code style. I invision my digital compositions from now on will consist of clean layouts with an edgy, modern twist. Ultimately, t's about making something uniquely mine â€“ something that unmistakably reflects my personality and style. My plan moving forward is to explore and experiment with HTML, constantly seeking new ways to push the boundaries of clean and modern design. I'll stay curious about emerging trends and technologies in web development. Additionally, I will hold more space for creativity and imagination - whether that be through interactive elements, unique colors, or trendy typography that set my work apart. While I've found my creative signature, I'm open to collaborating with others who bring their own unique strengths to the table. Collaborative projects can lead to fresh ideas and unexpected innovations. This class has been intrumental in helping be uncover my creative knack in coding, and I'm excited to continue developing it.  believe that by staying inquisitive, persistent, imaginative, disciplined, and open to collaboration, I can nurture this knack and create digital compositions that are not just functional but also truly unique and reflective of my creative identity.

       <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Throughout the workshop experience, the most valuable insight I've gained is inspiration. It's fascinating to see how, even when given the same prompt, each student's creation is unique and often takes a more figurative approach rather than a literal one. The experience of putting your own twist on assignments is pretty atypical to me to see in traditional school settings - which is more reason for me to take advantage of this creative environment. I've actively leveraged the workshop environment by engaging with my peers, asking them about their coding techniques and where they find pre-made code snippets. I'm also intrigued by their design processes. Learning about their different approaches has helped me discover what works best for me. Furthermore, I make it a point to provide constructive feedback to my peers, offering an alternative perspective to help enhance their work. As a peer, I understand my responsibility in sparking new possibilities for their designs. It's crucial that we, as a class, acknowledge that some students are more advanced than others, but that's perfectly fine because we can all benefit from the collaborative nature of the workshop. </p>

       <p><em>3. Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">In my journey with HTML, I've embarked on this path by immersing myself in various resources, such as instructional videos, to expand my repertoire. It may seem like a series of small steps, but the significance lies in the cumulative effect of these learning experiences. For instance, I've learned to incorporate elements like buttons and parallax scrolling, skills I hadn't possessed previously. What makes this journey even more fulfilling is the way I've not only acquired individual skills but also integrated them in conjunction with one another, creating a more comprehensive understanding of web development. I'm eager to apply this growing knowledge and skill set to undertake more substantial projects.</p>

       <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">I've been paying attention to evolving design trends in order to enhance the user experience, especially in anticipation of my upcoming project. I've been constantly asking myself how I can make my work more interactive, engaging, and memorable. To achieve this, I've drawn inspiration from my favorite websites, dissecting their elements to understand what captivates me as a user. Additionally, I've reached out to friends and family, seeking their input on how they envision the final digital form of my project.


   As a creator, I've also recognized the importance of ethical considerations in technology. It's crucial to refresh my knowledge on ethical guidelines and principles, particularly when drawing inspiration from other creators or incorporating various elements into my work. For instance, I've become mindful of the origins of images I use, questioning whether they are owned by freelance photographers and whether their use respects individual privacy. The purpose of research in my case is to not only remain an integral creator, but also become a multifaceted one. Meaning, I can take on projects of all kinds through research. Even if it is a topic or concept I am not familar with, I can research, learn, teach myself, and execute.</p>

       <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"> n the journey of learning how to present my work effectively in this class, I've identified several key factors. First and foremost, confidence plays a pivotal role; it's essential in articulating ideas and decisions with clarity and conviction. Additionally, readiness with a functional interface significantly streamlines the presentation process, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Furthermore, when challenges arise, I've adopted a problem-solving approach. I initially attempt to troubleshoot independently, exploring potential solutions. If needed, I reach out to my peers for their insights and perspectives, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Ultimately, if the issue persists, I'm not hesitant to seek guidance from our professor, recognizing the importance of proactive learning. This approach, combined with constructive feedback, contributes to my ongoing development in presenting work effectively, not only in this class but in future endeavors as well. </p>
